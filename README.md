### Welcome!

This is where I should add a bunch of fake colorful badges and meaningless stats ~~(like WTF, why would some random person want to know how much time I've spent sleeping this week?)~~ but instead I'll leave you with my _"super original"_ sense of humor.

Things that I like:
 - Online privacy and anonymity
 - Useful readme's
 - Software engineering and architecture

If you are still curious about what I do just [send me an email](mailto:ramonvilafer@gmail.com) and I'll reply you as soon as I can!
